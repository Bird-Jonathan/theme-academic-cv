	abstract = {New computer technologies, like virtual reality (VR), have created opportunities to study human behavior and train skills in novel ways. VR holds significant promise for maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of skill learning in a variety of settings (e.g., sport, medicine, safety-critical industries) through immersive learning and augmentation of existing training methods. In many cases the adoption of VR for training has, however, preceded rigorous testing and validation of the simulation tool. In order for VR to be implemented successfully for both training and psychological experimentation it is necessary to first establish whether the simulation captures fundamental features of the real task and environment, and elicits realistic behaviors. Unfortunately evaluation of VR environments too often confuses presentation and function, and relies on superficial visual features that are not the key determinants of successful training outcomes. Therefore evidence-based methods of establishing the fidelity and validity of VR environments are required. To this end, we outline a taxonomy of the subtypes of fidelity and validity, and propose a variety of practical methods for testing and validating VR training simulations. Ultimately, a successful VR environment is one that enables transfer of learning to the real-world. We propose that key elements of psychological, affective and ergonomic fidelity, are the real determinants of successful transfer. By adopting an evidence-based approach to VR simulation design and testing it is possible to develop valid environments that allow the potential of VR training to be maximized.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Physical inactivity remains a major global health concern, and researchers have been encouraged to explore the role of technology in the promotion of physical activity. Technologies that deliver audio-visual stimuli are frequently applied in the exercise domain. However, there is a paucity of research that examines the efficacy of modern virtual reality (VR) technology in this context. We investigated the effects of VR and music on affective, perceptual, enjoyment, and cardiac responses to aerobic-type exercise. Design. A fully counterbalanced, within-subjects design was employed. Methods. A convenience sample of recreationally active adult volunteers (N = 24) completed a 12-min protocol during which they exercised under music, VR, VR-withmusic, and control conditions. Results. Analyses indicated a Condition 9 Time interaction for affective valence and perceived activation. Moreover, a main effect of condition emerged for state attention and perceived enjoyment. The VR and VR-with-music conditions elicited the most positive affective valence, highest levels of perceived activation, greatest number of dissociative thoughts, and most exercise enjoyment. Differences between these two conditions were negligible across the breadth of dependent variables. Conclusions. The present findings illustrate the efficacy of modern VR technology in the exercise context, applied both with and without musical accompaniment. Additional research is required to assess the degree to which the findings are replicable among sedentary or ageing segments of the population. Given the emerging support pertaining to a positive relationship between affective responses and exercise adherence, VR technology should be considered as a means by which to promote an enjoyable exercise experience.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 lockdowns have reduced opportunities for physical activity (PA) and encouraged more sedentary lifestyles. A concomitant of sedentariness is compromised mental health. We investigated the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations (USA, UK, France, and Australia). An online survey was administered in the second quarter of 2020 (N = 2541). We measured planned and unplanned dimensions of PA using the Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire and mental health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Steps per day were recorded only from participants who used an electronic device for this purpose, and sedentary behavior was reported in hours per day (sitting and screen time). In the USA and Australia samples, there was a significant decline in planned PA from pre- to during lockdown. Among young adults, Australians exhibited the lowest planned PA scores, while in middle-aged groups, the UK recorded the highest. Young adults exhibited the largest reduction in unplanned PA. Across nations, there was a reduction of {\textasciitilde} 2000 steps per day. Large increases in sedentary behavior emerged during lockdown, which were most acute in young adults. Lockdown was associated with a decline in mental health that was more pronounced in women. The findings illustrate the deleterious effects of lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations. Australian young and lower middle-aged adults appeared to fare particularly badly in terms of planned PA. The reduction in steps per day is equivalent to the non-expenditure of {\textasciitilde} 100 kcal. Declines in mental health show how harmful lockdowns can be for women in particular.},

	abstract = {Motivational audiovisual stimuli such as music and video have been widely used in the realm of exercise and sport as a means by which to increase situational motivation and enhance performance. The present study addressed the mechanisms that underlie the effects of motivational stimuli on psychophysiological responses and exercise performance. Twenty-two participants completed fatiguing isometric handgrip-squeezing tasks under two experimental conditions (motivational audiovisual condition and neutral audiovisual condition) and a control condition. Electrical activity in the brain and working muscles was analyzed by use of electroencephalography and electromyography, respectively. Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 30 s. A single-item motivation scale was administered after each squeeze. Results indicated that task performance and situational motivational were superior under the inÔ¨Çuence of motivational stimuli when compared to the other two conditions (~20% and ~25%, respectively). The motivational stimulus downregulated the predominance of low-frequency waves (theta) in the right frontal regions of the cortex (F8), and upregulated high-frequency waves (beta) in the central areas (C3 and C4). It is suggested that motivational sensory cues serve to readjust electrical activity in the brain; a mechanism by which the detrimental effects of fatigue on the efferent control of working muscles is ameliorated.},

This is surprising given the ubiquity of this medium in exercise facilities. The present study sought to examine the impact of a musicvideo channel on the social process of exercising in a public exercise facility. Method: A grounded theory approach underpinned by pragmatism and symbolic interactionism was employed. Thirteen exercisers completed reflective diaries following each attendance at the facility over a 4-week period. Subsequently, 11 exercisers were interviewed regarding the impact of the musicvideo channel on the social process of exercising at the facility. Staff members‚Äô perspectives were deemed important throughout the iterative process of data collection and analysis. Accordingly, four staff members were interviewed with reference to the social process of managing an exercise facility that featured a music-video channel. Data were analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding. Results: The results provide support for a three-stage substantive theory that commences with the content of the music-video channel. The second stage depicts a series of moderators (e.g., exercise factors, temporal factors) that revolve around the core category, appraisal of the appropriateness of channel content. Lastly, a range of effects pertaining to exercisers and facility staff are predicted, and relevant social processes are expounded. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of music-video channels in contemporary exercise and health facilities, the substantive theory bears relevance to exercisers, health/performance practitioners, and researchers.},

Accordingly, we examined the influence of a range of audiovisual stimuli on the improvement of affective, perceptual, and enjoyment responses to cycle ergometer exercise at the ventilatory threshold (VT), an intensity that is associated with the most affect‚Äêrelated interindividual variability. A withinsubject design was employed, and participants (N¬† =¬† 18) completed a 25‚Äêminute protocol that consisted of 2¬†minutes of seated rest, 5¬†minutes of warm‚Äêup, 10¬†minutes of exercise at VT, 5¬†minutes of cooldown, and 3¬†minutes of seated rest.

There was a main effect of condition for affective valence, wherein the experimental conditions facilitated significantly higher affective valence than control. Significant main effects of time emerged for both affective valence and perceived activation. Regardless of condition, affective valence decreased during the exercise bout and increased immediately post exercise. Conversely, perceived activation increased during exercise and decreased immediately post exercise.

Thirty-four academy soccer players (Mage œ≠ 17.9 years, SD œ≠ 1.6 years) were selected from a U.K. Premier League soccer club. Individual- and group-based questionnaires, reÔ¨Çective journals, and interviews were administered. Corbin and Strauss‚Äôs (2015) variant of grounded theory was adopted, which is underpinned by pragmatism and symbolic interactionism. Data were analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding. Moreover, the data were continually compared with previous literature to verify methodological coherence, propose new methods, and develop a substantive grounded theory model. The Ô¨Åndings document the use of music as a stimulant and regulator of emotion prior to performance, as well as its propensity to develop shared meanings and contribute to a sense of group identity. The analysis brought to light personal-, group-, and task-related factors that moderate the inÔ¨Çuence of music on the psychological state of young soccer players. A unique Ô¨Ånding to emerge was the degree to which the music preferences of senior players were readily accepted by junior players. The present study provides evidence of the role that naturalistic research can play in fathoming and harnessing the emotive and encultured power of music within the social spheres of elite team sports. All emergent concepts can be used as a template to guide soccer players and practitioners in the use of music and to frame future research efforts.},

Exercise motives, PA, and mental health were measured by use of the Behavioural Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire-3, Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire, and General Health Questionnaire-12, respectively. Participants were also asked to specify their average step count per day, if they used a mobile device for this purpose (n¬†=¬†190). Analyses comprised hierarchical regressions and partial correlations. Results indicated that behavioural regulations were more strongly associated with planned PA pre-lockdown, compared to during lockdown. There were no differences observed in explained variance between pre- and during lockdown for unplanned PA and steps per day. Planned and unplanned PA were significant explanatory variables for mental health both pre- and during lockdown, but sedentary behaviour was not. Partial correlations, with BMI and age partialled out, showed that steps per day were not correlated with mental health either pre- or during lockdown. The range of variables used to explain planned and unplanned PA and mental health suggest that people's motives to exercise were tempered by lockdown. For those who routinely measured their steps per day, the step count was unrelated to their mental health scores both pre- and during lockdown. It appears that engagement in regular PA confers some minor benefits for mental health.},

Using the Embodiment‚ÄìPresence‚ÄìInteractivity Cube (Flavi√°n et al., 2019) as a guiding conceptual framework, the aim of this registered report was to examine how each dimension of the cube (i.e., embodiment, presence and interactivity) influenced a range of exercise-related affective and perceptual variables. A counterbalanced within-subjects design was employed (N = 24). Participants completed 20-min exercise bouts on a cycle ergometer under four conditions: Television, augmented reality, 360¬∞ video and virtual reality. A repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant Condition √ó Timepoint interaction for affective valence (p = 0.046), with greater embodiment offered by technological devices leading to more positive responses. Analyses also indicated main effects of condition for exercise enjoyment, remembered pleasure and forecasted pleasure, with greater presence of technological devices leading to more positive responses. Technologies that combine high levels of embodiment, presence and interactivity (e.g., virtual reality) appear to yield several benefits in terms of in-task (e.g., affective valence) and post-task (e.g., remembered pleasure) responses for exercise conducted at ventilatory threshold.},

	abstract = {Traditional videos are frequently employed to assess anticipation within interceptive sports. However, there are limitations associated with traditional videos which impair the degree of correspondence between training interventions and competitive performances. Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays allow for the presentation of immersive videos in 360-degrees that might offer a more effective means by which to train athletes. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of research examining the efficacy of immersive videos in a cricket context. The main purpose of the present investigation was to compare batters‚Äô ability to accurately predict the landing location of deliveries, and assess their confidence in such predictions, when viewing traditional and immersive videos. We also examined the degree to which delivery style (i.e., bowling machine, throwdowns, spin, and pace bowling) impacted prediction accuracy and confidence scores. Forty deliveries (i.e., 10 per style; occluded at 120¬†ms post-ball release) were presented to amateur cricketers (N¬†=¬†18) in traditional and immersive video conditions. Participants were required to anticipate the landing location of the ball and rate their prediction confidence after each delivery. Analyses indicated a main effect of viewing condition that applied only to prediction. Participants predicted the landing location of the ball with the greatest accuracy in the immersive video footage condition. There was a main effect of delivery style for confidence only, with higher scores observed in the throwdown, spin, and pace conditions, when compared to the bowling machine. Given the increasing rate at which VR is becoming accessible, immersive videos should be considered by sport psychologists as an effective means by which to assess anticipation in cricket.},

	abstract = {The present programme of research sought to examine the effects of audio-visual stimuli during exercise, using immersive, commercially available technologies. Three original studies were conducted using a range of settings (i.e., real-world, laboratory), methodologies (i.e., qualitative and quantitative), exercise modalities (i.e., gym workouts, cycle ergometry) and consumer products (e.g., music-video channels, virtual reality head-mounted displays) in order to explore the main research question from various perspectives. A substantive theory was proposed in Study 1 that sought to explain and predict the social process of exercising in the presence of a music-video channel. The model provides support for a three-stage process that commences with the content of the music-video channel. The second stage depicts a series of moderators that revolve around the core category, appraisal of appropriateness. Lastly, a range of effects pertaining to exercisers and facility staff are predicted. Study 2 sought to examine the influence of a range of audio-visual stimuli on cycle ergometer exercise at the ventilatory threshold. The findings indicated that a 360-degree video with music condition elicited the most positive affective valence, greatest perceived activation, most dissociative thoughts, and highest ratings of perceived enjoyment. Study 3 sought to veer towards greater ecological validity with the inclusion of a commercially available virtual reality-enabled cycle ergometer. The findings demonstrated the efficacy of such technology, as conditions that entailed virtual reality elicited the most positive affective valence, highest perceived activation, largest number of dissociative thoughts, and greatest perceived enjoyment. Taken holistically, the present body of work demonstrates that audio-visual stimuli can serve as a catalyst for several affective, cognitive, and behavioural effects across various exercise modes and intensities. Researchers are beginning to recognise the importance of affective responses in shaping future exercise behaviours. The addition of audio-visual stimuli within the exercise environment represents a cost-effective and easily implementable intervention that might encourage individuals to partake in regular exercise.},

	abstract = {Sensory interventions refer to a subset of extrinsic strategies designed to enhance the exercise environment, by directly targeting one or more of an exerciser‚Äôs sensory systems (e.g., auditory, visual). In this chapter, we review recent work exploring the application of sensory interventions to improve exercise tolerance, which concerns the ability to continue exercising at an imposed intensity, even when the activity becomes uncomfortable or unpleasant. We begin with an overview of exercise tolerance, and we draw upon recent theory to describe the dynamic between exercise session characteristics, tolerance levels, and affective responses. We then provide readers with a comprehensive review of the most frequently employed sensory interventions used to improve exercise tolerance. These are categorized as auditory, auditory and visual, and olfactory and gustatory sensory interventions. We then describe psychophysiological assessments that can be used to validate the efficacy of sensory interventions. Specifically, we focus on measures of heart rate variability (HRV), electroencephalography (EEG), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The concluding section reiterates key messages from the extant literature and provides the scientist-practitioner with a set of evidence-based recommendations.},

Sixty‚Äêsix participants were randomised to either the AT or ST condition and completed an 8‚Äêweek intervention. Participants completed 3 weekly, 30‚Äêminute sessions of moderate intensity AT (65‚Äì75% VO2 max) or ST (65‚Äì75% 1‚ÄêRM). The energy consumption of each session was approximately equivalent under both conditions. Body satisfaction, body composition, perceived fitness and exercise self‚Äêefficacy were measured at baseline and biweekly during the intervention. Exercise improved individuals' body satisfaction (p <‚Äâ.05). When the energy expenditures of AT and ST were equal, there was no difference in body satisfaction improvement. There were dynamic mechanisms underlying the effects of exercise on body satisfaction. Specifically, perceived fitness influenced body satisfaction improvements during the early stages of the exercise program, while changes in body composition influenced body satisfaction toward the end of the exercise program. There were sex differences in the mechanisms underlying body satisfaction. For women, perceived fat was more important in the early intervention period; for men, actual body fat was more valuable in the late intervention period. An effective strategy to improve body satisfaction is to initially target perceived fitness before focusing on changing body composition.},

	abstract = {Previous research suggests that the processing of internal body sensations (interoception) affects how we experience pain. Some evidence suggests that people with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) ‚Äì a condition characterised by chronic pain and fatigue ‚Äì may have altered interoceptive processing. However, extant findings are inconclusive, and some tasks previously used to measure interoception are of questionable validity. Here, we used an alternative measure ‚Äì the Phase Adjustment Task (PAT) ‚Äì to examine cardiac interoceptive accuracy in adults with FMS. We examined: (i) the tolerability of the PAT in an FMS sample (N¬†=¬†154); (ii) if there are differences in facets of interoception (PAT performance, PAT-related confidence, and scores on the Private Body Consciousness Scale) between an FMS sample and an age- and gender-matched pain-free sample (N¬†=¬†94); and (iii) if subgroups of participants with FMS are identifiable according to interoceptive accuracy levels. We found the PAT was tolerable in the FMS sample, with additional task breaks and a recommended hand posture. The FMS sample were more likely to be classified as ‚Äòinteroceptive‚Äô on the PAT, and had significantly higher self-reported interoception compared to the pain-free sample. Within the FMS sample, we identified a subgroup who demonstrated very strong evidence of being interoceptive, and concurrently had lower fibromyalgia symptom impact (although the effect size was small). Conversely, self-reported interoception was positively correlated with FMS symptom severity and impact. Overall, interoception may be an important factor to consider in understanding and managing FMS symptoms. We recommend future longitudinal work to better understand associations between fluctuating FMS symptoms and interoception.},

However, interpretation of existing evidence in the cardiac domain is hindered by the limitations of existing tools. In this investigation, we pooled data from several samples to examine sex differences in cardiac interoceptive accuracy on the phase adjustment task, a new measure that overcomes several limitations of the existing tools. In a sample of 266 individuals, we observed that females outperformed males, indicative of better cardiac interoceptive accuracy, but had lower confidence than males. These results held after controlling for sex differences in demographic, physiological and engagement factors. Importantly, these results were specific to the measure of cardiac interoceptive accuracy. No sex differences were observed for individuals who completed the structurally identical screener task, although a similar pattern of results was observed in relation to confidence. These surprising data suggest the presence of a female advantage for cardiac interoceptive accuracy and potential differences in interoceptive awareness (metacognition). Possible reasons for mixed results in the literature, as well as implications for theory and future research, are discussed.},

Encouragingly, some journals have statements of aim or purpose that explicitly call for business practice implications in manuscript submissions (e.g., Business Horizons). However, these journals rarely call for policy implications, even though such implications may have a broader-reaching impact on business practice. Moreover, researchers lack concrete and actionable guidance for bridging the research-policy gap. We address this challenge by developing SPARC: A framework that helps management scholars design impactful research and derive policy implications. SPARC is an abbreviation for societal challenge (S), pragmatism (P), action (A), result (R), and connections (C). We describe each component and provide specific, sequential, and actionable steps. Moreover, to not just tell but to show its effectiveness and usefulness in enhancing research‚Äôs impact on policymaking, we demonstrate how to apply SPARC for both research planning and dissemination. By narrowing the research-policy gap, SPARC provides researchers with actionable tools to become policademics, thereby improving the field of management‚Äôs societal impact, relevance, and stature.},
