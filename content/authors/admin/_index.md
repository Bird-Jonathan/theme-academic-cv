Dr Jonathan Bird is a Research Fellow at the University of Exeter. He is interested in the scientific application of immersive technology (e.g., virtual reality, augmented reality). This work spans several contexts, such as health and exercise, sport, and cultural heritage. I am particularly interested in the cognitive (e.g., visual attention), affective (e.g., emotion, mood), and behavioural (e.g., adherence) responses of such technology use.

Dr Jonathan Bird has a strong interest in applied sport psychology, and is accredited as a Sport and Exercise Scientist with the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences. He is also a chartered member of the UKâ€™s Science Council and has worked as a consultant with athletes from a wide variety of sports.
