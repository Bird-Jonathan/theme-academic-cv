I am a Research Fellow at the Institute for Sport, Exercise, and Health ([ISEH](https://iseh.co.uk/)) at University College London, where my work focuses on developing and testing digital interventions to promote physical and mental health. A central strand of my research explores the potential of extended reality (XR) technologies—such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality—to enhance exercise experiences. I am particularly interested in how these digital tools can shape affective/feeling states and cognitive processes during exercise, and how such changes can influence future behaviour.

Alongside my academic work, I have a strong interest in applied sport psychology. I am accredited as a Sport and Exercise Scientist with the Chartered Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences ([CASES](https://www.cases.org.uk/index.html)) and a Chartered Scientist with the UK’s [Science Council](https://sciencecouncil.org/). I have worked extensively as a consultant, supporting athletes across a wide range of sports to optimise performance and wellbeing.

I welcome opportunities to collaborate with researchers, practitioners, and industry partners who share my interests in digital health, sport and exercise psychology, and XR technologies. Please feel free to get in touch to explore potential projects or partnerships.
