abstract: The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of music and
  music-video on core affect during and immediately after stationary cycling at the
  lactate threshold. A randomized, fully counterbalanced, crossover design with three
  conditions (music, music-video, and a nomusic-video control) was adopted. Twenty-four
  participants exercised at lactate threshold while exposed to music, music-video,
  and control conditions. Affective valence and perceived activation were assessed
  every 2 min during a 20-min exercise bout and every 5 min post exercise over a 20-min
  period. Results indicated that there was a significant condition x time interaction
  for affective valence. The music-video condition elicited the highest levels of
  affective valence followed by the music condition and control. There was a main
  effect of condition for affective valence, wherein the experimental conditions facilitated
  significantly higher affective valence than control. Significant main effects of
  time emerged for both affective valence and perceived activation. Regardless of
  condition, affective valence decreased during the exercise bout and increased immediately
  post exercise. Conversely, perceived activation increased during exercise and decreased
  immediately post exercise. The present findings indicate that music and musicvideo
  can enhance core affect during exercise at the lactate threshold and the implications
  for exercise adherence are expounded.
