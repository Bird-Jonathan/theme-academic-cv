abstract: Introduction. We compared the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on mental
  health (MH) and physical activity (PA) between US adults who identify as lesbian,
  gay men, bisexual, queer, asexual, and pansexual (LGBQAP) and heterosexual US adults.
  Method. Participants completed online questionnaires to assess PA and MH. Results.
  No difference in MH was identified between LGBQAP and heterosexual participants
  prior to lockdown, however LGBQAP participants reported significantly worse mental
  health during lockdown. No group differences were found in PA, but all participants
  exhibited a decline in PA during lockdown. Conclusion. This study highlights the
  differential impact of social restrictions on marginalized populations.
