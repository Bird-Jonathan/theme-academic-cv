abstract: 'Ultraprocessed food (UPF) consumption is associated with noncommunicable
  disease risk, yet no trial has assessed its health impact within the context of
  national dietary guidelines. In a 2 × 2 crossover randomized controlled feeding
  trial, 55 adults in England (body mass index ≥25 to textless40 kg m−2, habitual
  UPF intake ≥50% kcal day−1) were provided with two 8-week ad libitum diets following
  the UK Eatwell Guide: (1) minimally processed food (MPF) and (2) UPF, in a random
  order. Twenty-eight people were randomized to MPF then UPF, and 27 to UPF then MPF;
  50 participants comprised the intention-to-treat sample. The primary outcome was
  the within-participant difference in percent weight change (%WC) between diets,
  from baseline to week 8. Participants were blinded to the primary outcome. MPF (%WC,
  −2.06 (95% confidence interval (CI), −2.99, −1.13) and UPF (%WC, −1.05 (95% CI,
  −1.98, −0.13)) resulted in weight loss, with significantly greater %WC on MPF (Δ%WC,
  −1.01 (95% CI, −1.87, −0.14), P = 0.024; Cohen’s d, −0.48 (95% CI, −0.91, −0.06)).
  Mild gastrointestinal adverse events were common on both diets. Findings indicate
  greater weight loss on MPF than UPF diets and needing dietary guidance on food processing
  in addition to existing recommendations. Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT05627570.'
