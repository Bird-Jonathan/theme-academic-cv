abstract: Virtual reality (VR) technology has been employed within several domains
  such as medicine, education, and the military. Nonetheless, there is limited research
  examining how VR can supplement applied sport psychology practice. This article
  provides the reader with an understanding of key components and concepts associated
  with VR head-mounted displays (HMDs). Subsequently, a range of possible applications
  within applied sport psychology are discussed, such as the training of perceptual-cognitive
  skills, relaxation strategies, and injury rehabilitation. Thereafter, the practicalities
  of using VR HMDs are outlined, and recommendations are provided to applied sport
  psychology practitioners wishing to embed this technology within their practice.
