abstract: A nationwide survey was conducted during the first UK lockdown to further
  understanding of the degree to which motives for exercise were associated with physical
  activity (PA) behaviours and, in turn, how PA behaviours were associated with mental
  health. A cross-sectional design was employed and data were collected by use of
  a one-off online survey (N = 392; 18–85 years; MBMI = 25.48; SDBMI = 5.05; 314 women).
  Exercise motives, PA, and mental health were measured by use of the Behavioural
  Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire-3, Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire,
  and General Health Questionnaire-12, respectively. Participants were also asked
  to specify their average step count per day, if they used a mobile device for this
  purpose (n = 190). Analyses comprised hierarchical regressions and partial correlations.
  Results indicated that behavioural regulations were more strongly associated with
  planned PA pre-lockdown, compared to during lockdown. There were no differences
  observed in explained variance between pre- and during lockdown for unplanned PA
  and steps per day. Planned and unplanned PA were significant explanatory variables
  for mental health both pre- and during lockdown, but sedentary behaviour was not.
  Partial correlations, with BMI and age partialled out, showed that steps per day
  were not correlated with mental health either pre- or during lockdown. The range
  of variables used to explain planned and unplanned PA and mental health suggest
  that people's motives to exercise were tempered by lockdown. For those who routinely
  measured their steps per day, the step count was unrelated to their mental health
  scores both pre- and during lockdown. It appears that engagement in regular PA confers
  some minor benefits for mental health.
