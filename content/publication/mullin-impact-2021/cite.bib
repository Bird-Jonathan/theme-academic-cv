 abstract = {Introduction. We compared the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on mental health (MH) and physical activity (PA) between US adults who identify as lesbian, gay men, bisexual, queer, asexual, and pansexual (LGBQAP) and heterosexual US adults. Method. Participants completed online questionnaires to assess PA and MH. Results. No difference in MH was identified between LGBQAP and heterosexual participants prior to lockdown, however LGBQAP participants reported significantly worse mental health during lockdown. No group differences were found in PA, but all participants exhibited a decline in PA during lockdown. Conclusion. This study highlights the differential impact of social restrictions on marginalized populations.},
