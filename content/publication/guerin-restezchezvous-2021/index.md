abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of lockdown on mental
  health, levels of physical activity, and sedentary behaviour. A sample of 739 adults
  living in urban and rural areas completed an online survey during the initial period
  of lockdown in France. Results indicated the importance of developing routines to
  maintain levels of physical activity in order to minimize the psychological impact
  of lockdown, especially among young women living in urban areas.
