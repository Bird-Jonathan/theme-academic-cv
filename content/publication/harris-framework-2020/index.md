abstract: New computer technologies, like virtual reality (VR), have created opportunities
  to study human behavior and train skills in novel ways. VR holds significant promise
  for maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of skill learning in a variety of
  settings (e.g., sport, medicine, safety-critical industries) through immersive learning
  and augmentation of existing training methods. In many cases the adoption of VR
  for training has, however, preceded rigorous testing and validation of the simulation
  tool. In order for VR to be implemented successfully for both training and psychological
  experimentation it is necessary to first establish whether the simulation captures
  fundamental features of the real task and environment, and elicits realistic behaviors.
  Unfortunately evaluation of VR environments too often confuses presentation and
  function, and relies on superficial visual features that are not the key determinants
  of successful training outcomes. Therefore evidence-based methods of establishing
  the fidelity and validity of VR environments are required. To this end, we outline
  a taxonomy of the subtypes of fidelity and validity, and propose a variety of practical
  methods for testing and validating VR training simulations. Ultimately, a successful
  VR environment is one that enables transfer of learning to the real-world. We propose
  that key elements of psychological, affective and ergonomic fidelity, are the real
  determinants of successful transfer. By adopting an evidence-based approach to VR
  simulation design and testing it is possible to develop valid environments that
  allow the potential of VR training to be maximized.
