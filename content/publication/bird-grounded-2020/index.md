abstract: 'Purpose: Despite considerable interest in the effects of music in an exercise
  context, there is a dearth of research examining the use of music-videos. This is
  surprising given the ubiquity of this medium in exercise facilities. The present
  study sought to examine the impact of a musicvideo channel on the social process
  of exercising in a public exercise facility. Method: A grounded theory approach
  underpinned by pragmatism and symbolic interactionism was employed. Thirteen exercisers
  completed reflective diaries following each attendance at the facility over a 4-week
  period. Subsequently, 11 exercisers were interviewed regarding the impact of the
  musicvideo channel on the social process of exercising at the facility. Staff membersâ€™
  perspectives were deemed important throughout the iterative process of data collection
  and analysis. Accordingly, four staff members were interviewed with reference to
  the social process of managing an exercise facility that featured a music-video
  channel. Data were analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding. Results: The
  results provide support for a three-stage substantive theory that commences with
  the content of the music-video channel. The second stage depicts a series of moderators
  (e.g., exercise factors, temporal factors) that revolve around the core category,
  appraisal of the appropriateness of channel content. Lastly, a range of effects
  pertaining to exercisers and facility staff are predicted, and relevant social processes
  are expounded. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of music-video channels in contemporary
  exercise and health facilities, the substantive theory bears relevance to exercisers,
  health/performance practitioners, and researchers.'
