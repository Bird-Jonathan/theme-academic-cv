abstract: 'Augmented reality (AR) is an emergent technology in tourism. However, research
  concerning the AR user experience is relatively scarce and seldom addresses the
  intentions of designers. Accordingly, we sought to: (a) explore the design intentions
  underlying a multi-user, purpose-built AR experience; (b) assess the extent to which
  users? realized experience aligned with the designers? intended experience; and
  (c) examine the relationships between users? internal states and their associated
  behavior, in alignment with a Stimulus-Organism-Response framework. In Study 1,
  designers (n?=?5) took part in a focus group and completed a design intentions survey.
  In Study 2, users (n?=?48) tested the AR experience, and a range of subjective (e.g.,
  affective responses) and objective (i.e., visual attention) data were recorded.
  Findings indicated designer?user disparities primarily at the organism and response
  levels. Additionally, users? affective responses to the AR experience were strongly
  associated with visitor engagement.'
