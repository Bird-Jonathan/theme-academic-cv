 abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is an emergent technology in tourism. However, research concerning the AR user experience is relatively scarce and seldom addresses the intentions of designers. Accordingly, we sought to: (a) explore the design intentions underlying a multi-user, purpose-built AR experience; (b) assess the extent to which users? realized experience aligned with the designers? intended experience; and (c) examine the relationships between users? internal states and their associated behavior, in alignment with a Stimulus-Organism-Response framework. In Study 1, designers (n?=?5) took part in a focus group and completed a design intentions survey. In Study 2, users (n?=?48) tested the AR experience, and a range of subjective (e.g., affective responses) and objective (i.e., visual attention) data were recorded. Findings indicated designer?user disparities primarily at the organism and response levels. Additionally, users? affective responses to the AR experience were strongly associated with visitor engagement.},
