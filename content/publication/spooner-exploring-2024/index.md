abstract: Previous evidence suggests males and females differ with respect to interoception—the
  processing of internal bodily signals—with males typically outperforming females
  on tasks of interoceptive accuracy. However, interpretation of existing evidence
  in the cardiac domain is hindered by the limitations of existing tools. In this
  investigation, we pooled data from several samples to examine sex differences in
  cardiac interoceptive accuracy on the phase adjustment task, a new measure that
  overcomes several limitations of the existing tools. In a sample of 266 individuals,
  we observed that females outperformed males, indicative of better cardiac interoceptive
  accuracy, but had lower confidence than males. These results held after controlling
  for sex differences in demographic, physiological and engagement factors. Importantly,
  these results were specific to the measure of cardiac interoceptive accuracy. No
  sex differences were observed for individuals who completed the structurally identical
  screener task, although a similar pattern of results was observed in relation to
  confidence. These surprising data suggest the presence of a female advantage for
  cardiac interoceptive accuracy and potential differences in interoceptive awareness
  (metacognition). Possible reasons for mixed results in the literature, as well as
  implications for theory and future research, are discussed.
