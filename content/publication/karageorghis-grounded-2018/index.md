abstract: The main objectives of the present study are (a) to examine soccer players’
  use of music to psychologically prepare for performance and (b) to present a grounded
  theory to illuminate this phenomenon. Thirty-four academy soccer players (Mage ϭ
  17.9 years, SD ϭ 1.6 years) were selected from a U.K. Premier League soccer club.
  Individual- and group-based questionnaires, reﬂective journals, and interviews were
  administered. Corbin and Strauss’s (2015) variant of grounded theory was adopted,
  which is underpinned by pragmatism and symbolic interactionism. Data were analyzed
  using open, axial, and selective coding. Moreover, the data were continually compared
  with previous literature to verify methodological coherence, propose new methods,
  and develop a substantive grounded theory model. The ﬁndings document the use of
  music as a stimulant and regulator of emotion prior to performance, as well as its
  propensity to develop shared meanings and contribute to a sense of group identity.
  The analysis brought to light personal-, group-, and task-related factors that moderate
  the inﬂuence of music on the psychological state of young soccer players. A unique
  ﬁnding to emerge was the degree to which the music preferences of senior players
  were readily accepted by junior players. The present study provides evidence of
  the role that naturalistic research can play in fathoming and harnessing the emotive
  and encultured power of music within the social spheres of elite team sports. All
  emergent concepts can be used as a template to guide soccer players and practitioners
  in the use of music and to frame future research efforts.
