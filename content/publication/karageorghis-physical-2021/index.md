abstract: COVID-19 lockdowns have reduced opportunities for physical activity (PA)
  and encouraged more sedentary lifestyles. A concomitant of sedentariness is compromised
  mental health. We investigated the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on PA, sedentary
  behavior, and mental health across four Western nations (USA, UK, France, and Australia).
  An online survey was administered in the second quarter of 2020 (N = 2541). We measured
  planned and unplanned dimensions of PA using the Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity
  Questionnaire and mental health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire.
  Steps per day were recorded only from participants who used an electronic device
  for this purpose, and sedentary behavior was reported in hours per day (sitting
  and screen time). In the USA and Australia samples, there was a significant decline
  in planned PA from pre- to during lockdown. Among young adults, Australians exhibited
  the lowest planned PA scores, while in middle-aged groups, the UK recorded the highest.
  Young adults exhibited the largest reduction in unplanned PA. Across nations, there
  was a reduction of ~ 2000 steps per day. Large increases in sedentary behavior emerged
  during lockdown, which were most acute in young adults. Lockdown was associated
  with a decline in mental health that was more pronounced in women. The findings
  illustrate the deleterious effects of lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental
  health across four Western nations. Australian young and lower middle-aged adults
  appeared to fare particularly badly in terms of planned PA. The reduction in steps
  per day is equivalent to the non-expenditure of ~ 100 kcal. Declines in mental health
  show how harmful lockdowns can be for women in particular.
