abstract: Objectives. Physical inactivity remains a major global health concern, and
  researchers have been encouraged to explore the role of technology in the promotion
  of physical activity. Technologies that deliver audio-visual stimuli are frequently
  applied in the exercise domain. However, there is a paucity of research that examines
  the efficacy of modern virtual reality (VR) technology in this context. We investigated
  the effects of VR and music on affective, perceptual, enjoyment, and cardiac responses
  to aerobic-type exercise. Design. A fully counterbalanced, within-subjects design
  was employed. Methods. A convenience sample of recreationally active adult volunteers
  (N = 24) completed a 12-min protocol during which they exercised under music, VR,
  VR-withmusic, and control conditions. Results. Analyses indicated a Condition 9
  Time interaction for affective valence and perceived activation. Moreover, a main
  effect of condition emerged for state attention and perceived enjoyment. The VR
  and VR-with-music conditions elicited the most positive affective valence, highest
  levels of perceived activation, greatest number of dissociative thoughts, and most
  exercise enjoyment. Differences between these two conditions were negligible across
  the breadth of dependent variables. Conclusions. The present findings illustrate
  the efficacy of modern VR technology in the exercise context, applied both with
  and without musical accompaniment. Additional research is required to assess the
  degree to which the findings are replicable among sedentary or ageing segments of
  the population. Given the emerging support pertaining to a positive relationship
  between affective responses and exercise adherence, VR technology should be considered
  as a means by which to promote an enjoyable exercise experience.
