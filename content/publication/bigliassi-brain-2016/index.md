abstract: Motivational audiovisual stimuli such as music and video have been widely
  used in the realm of exercise and sport as a means by which to increase situational
  motivation and enhance performance. The present study addressed the mechanisms that
  underlie the effects of motivational stimuli on psychophysiological responses and
  exercise performance. Twenty-two participants completed fatiguing isometric handgrip-squeezing
  tasks under two experimental conditions (motivational audiovisual condition and
  neutral audiovisual condition) and a control condition. Electrical activity in the
  brain and working muscles was analyzed by use of electroencephalography and electromyography,
  respectively. Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 30
  s. A single-item motivation scale was administered after each squeeze. Results indicated
  that task performance and situational motivational were superior under the inï¬‚uence
  of motivational stimuli when compared to the other two conditions (~20% and ~25%,
  respectively). The motivational stimulus downregulated the predominance of low-frequency
  waves (theta) in the right frontal regions of the cortex (F8), and upregulated high-frequency
  waves (beta) in the central areas (C3 and C4). It is suggested that motivational
  sensory cues serve to readjust electrical activity in the brain; a mechanism by
  which the detrimental effects of fatigue on the efferent control of working muscles
  is ameliorated.
