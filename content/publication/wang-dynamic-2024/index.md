abstract: We examined the dynamic mechanisms of aerobic training (AT) and strength
  training (ST) to improve body satisfaction. Sixty‐six participants were randomised
  to either the AT or ST condition and completed an 8‐week intervention. Participants
  completed 3 weekly, 30‐minute sessions of moderate intensity AT (65–75% VO2 max)
  or ST (65–75% 1‐RM). The energy consumption of each session was approximately equivalent
  under both conditions. Body satisfaction, body composition, perceived fitness and
  exercise self‐efficacy were measured at baseline and biweekly during the intervention.
  Exercise improved individuals' body satisfaction (p < .05). When the energy expenditures
  of AT and ST were equal, there was no difference in body satisfaction improvement.
  There were dynamic mechanisms underlying the effects of exercise on body satisfaction.
  Specifically, perceived fitness influenced body satisfaction improvements during
  the early stages of the exercise program, while changes in body composition influenced
  body satisfaction toward the end of the exercise program. There were sex differences
  in the mechanisms underlying body satisfaction. For women, perceived fat was more
  important in the early intervention period; for men, actual body fat was more valuable
  in the late intervention period. An effective strategy to improve body satisfaction
  is to initially target perceived fitness before focusing on changing body composition.
