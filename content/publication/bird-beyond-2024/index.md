abstract: 'Evidence-based interventions are needed to promote engagement in physical
  activity. Audio-visual stimuli are frequently employed to enhance the exercise experience.
  Nonetheless, there is a paucity of research that examines the qualities of technological
  devices that are employed. Using the Embodiment–Presence–Interactivity Cube (Flavián
  et al., 2019) as a guiding conceptual framework, the aim of this registered report
  was to examine how each dimension of the cube (i.e., embodiment, presence and interactivity)
  influenced a range of exercise-related affective and perceptual variables. A counterbalanced
  within-subjects design was employed (N = 24). Participants completed 20-min exercise
  bouts on a cycle ergometer under four conditions: Television, augmented reality,
  360° video and virtual reality. A repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant
  Condition × Timepoint interaction for affective valence (p = 0.046), with greater
  embodiment offered by technological devices leading to more positive responses.
  Analyses also indicated main effects of condition for exercise enjoyment, remembered
  pleasure and forecasted pleasure, with greater presence of technological devices
  leading to more positive responses. Technologies that combine high levels of embodiment,
  presence and interactivity (e.g., virtual reality) appear to yield several benefits
  in terms of in-task (e.g., affective valence) and post-task (e.g., remembered pleasure)
  responses for exercise conducted at ventilatory threshold.'
