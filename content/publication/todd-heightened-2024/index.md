abstract: 'Previous research suggests that the processing of internal body sensations
  (interoception) affects how we experience pain. Some evidence suggests that people
  with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) – a condition characterised by chronic pain and
  fatigue – may have altered interoceptive processing. However, extant findings are
  inconclusive, and some tasks previously used to measure interoception are of questionable
  validity. Here, we used an alternative measure – the Phase Adjustment Task (PAT)
  – to examine cardiac interoceptive accuracy in adults with FMS. We examined: (i)
  the tolerability of the PAT in an FMS sample (N = 154); (ii) if there are differences
  in facets of interoception (PAT performance, PAT-related confidence, and scores
  on the Private Body Consciousness Scale) between an FMS sample and an age- and gender-matched
  pain-free sample (N = 94); and (iii) if subgroups of participants with FMS are identifiable
  according to interoceptive accuracy levels. We found the PAT was tolerable in the
  FMS sample, with additional task breaks and a recommended hand posture. The FMS
  sample were more likely to be classified as ‘interoceptive’ on the PAT, and had
  significantly higher self-reported interoception compared to the pain-free sample.
  Within the FMS sample, we identified a subgroup who demonstrated very strong evidence
  of being interoceptive, and concurrently had lower fibromyalgia symptom impact (although
  the effect size was small). Conversely, self-reported interoception was positively
  correlated with FMS symptom severity and impact. Overall, interoception may be an
  important factor to consider in understanding and managing FMS symptoms. We recommend
  future longitudinal work to better understand associations between fluctuating FMS
  symptoms and interoception.'
